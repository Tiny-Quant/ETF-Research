# ETF-Research

The goal of this project was to analyze the various market tracking ETF to form a simple 
portfolio that would maximize returns in the long term. We were not as concerned with risk
as the securities would be held as retirement savings for a long time. 

Stage 1: Market ETF Data.rmd: We analyzed a select number of major market indexes: S&P 500,
NASDAQ, US Treasuries, MBS, Commidities, Developed International Markets, Emerging Markets,
etc. It was by no means an exhaustively list, but we thought it covered the major markets 
retail investor aimed at retirement were considering. This stage lead to 3 conclusions: 
1. Most market indexes return between 5-7% quarterly with differing levels of volatility. 
2. The most inversely correlated asset classes to the general market are MBS and US 
Treasuries; however, MBS returns are trivally low without leverage. 
3. Most market move together even when factoring sector overweighting and geography. 

Stage 2: Lever-Up.rmd: After stage 1 we discerned that the most efficient means of 
diversification was investing in the S&P 500 and US Treasuries only. We then added 
the use of leveraged ETFs to amplifying returns. We then optimized a portfolio containing 
the two market EFTs as well as their leveraged counterparts. 

Stage 3: We excuted trades on 1/4/2021 to establish the portfolio discribed in stage 2. The
returns have been extremely positive thus far; however, we are waiting until 1/4/2022 for a 
full year of data to begin the deep analysis. We are cautiously optimistic. 

Status: In Progress.
